## MSBuild

A common scenario for generating code from OpenAPI specifications is to do it at build time. This can be achieved using MSBuild tasks. An example of such an approach would be to include a `.refitter` file in the projects directory and execute the Refitter CLI from pre-build events

```xml
<Target Name="Refitter" AfterTargets="PreBuildEvent">
    <Exec WorkingDirectory="$(ProjectDir)" Command="refitter --settings-file .refitter --skip-validation" />
</Target>
```

The snippet above requires that Refitter is installed on the machine as a globally available dotnet tool. This might not be the case if you're running on a build agent from a CI/CD environment. In this case you might want to install Refitter as a local tool using a manifest file, as described in [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/local-tools-how-to-use?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5004822)

```xml
<Target Name="Refitter" AfterTargets="PreBuildEvent">
    <Exec WorkingDirectory="$(ProjectDir)" Command="dotnet tool restore" />
    <Exec WorkingDirectory="$(ProjectDir)" Command="refitter --settings-file .refitter --skip-validation" />
</Target>
```

The `dotnet build` process does will probably not have access to the package repository in which to download Refitter from, this is at least the case with Azure Pipelines and Azure Artifacts. To workaround this, you can provide a separate `nuget.config` that only uses `nuget.org` as a `<packageSource>`.

Something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="NuGet" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

You might want to place the `nuget.config` file in another folder to avoid using it to build the .NET project, then you can specify this when executing `dotnet tool restore`

```xml
<Target Name="Refitter" AfterTargets="PreBuildEvent">
    <Exec WorkingDirectory="$(ProjectDir)" Command="dotnet tool restore --configfile refitter/nuget.config" />
    <Exec WorkingDirectory="$(ProjectDir)" Command="refitter --settings-file .refitter --skip-validation" />
</Target>
```

In the example above, the `nuget.config` file is placed under the `refitter` folder.

### Refitter.MSBuild package

Refitter ships with an MSBuild custom task that is distributed as a NuGet package and includes the Refitter CLI binary. This will simplify generating code from OpenAPI specifications at build time.

To use the package, install `Refitter.MSBuild`

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Refitter.MSBuild" Version="1.6.3" />
</ItemGroup>
```

The MSBuild package includes a custom `.target` file which executes the `RefitterGenerateTask` custom task and looks something like this:

```xml
<UsingTask TaskName="RefitterGenerateTask" 
           AssemblyFile="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)Refitter.MSBuild.dll" 
           Condition="Exists('$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)Refitter.MSBuild.dll')" />
<Target Name="RefitterGenerate" BeforeTargets="BeforeCompile">
    <RefitterGenerateTask ProjectFileDirectory="$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)"
                          DisableLogging="$(RefitterNoLogging)">
        <Output TaskParameter="GeneratedFiles" ItemName="RefitterGeneratedFiles" />
    </RefitterGenerateTask>
    <ItemGroup>
        <Compile Include="@(RefitterGeneratedFiles)" />
    </ItemGroup>
</Target>
```

The `RefitterGenerateTask` task will scan the project folder for `.refitter` files and executes them all. By default, telemetry collection is enabled, and to opt-out of it you must specify `<RefitterNoLogging>true</RefitterNoLogging>` in the `.csproj` `<PropertyGroup>`
